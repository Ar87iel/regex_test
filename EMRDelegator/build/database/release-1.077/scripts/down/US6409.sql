UPDATE `Agreement` SET `Preface`='Hi Member,\n\n\n We\'ve made few minor tweaks to the WebPT Terms of Service-most importantly, the added requirement that you use a unique email address in your WebPT account-and we\'d like your agreement. Please note: <b>There are no changes in current pricing, costs, or services.</b>\n\n\n All users must acknowledge these revised Terms of Service, so you won\'t be able to access the WebPT application until you accept. We know this is a bother, but it\'s our responsibility to provide you with the opportunity to review and subsequently accept the changes. If you have any questions or wish to discuss this further, please contact Member Support at <a href="tel:866-221-1870">866-221-1870</a>, option 2, or email <a href="mailto:support@webpt.com">support@webpt.com</a>.\n\n\n Thank you, \n\n\nWebPT, Inc.' WHERE `AgreementId`='5';
